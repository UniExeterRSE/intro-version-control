## Welcome

This workshop was put together by the Research Software Engineering Group.
This is as part of an ongoing initiative to provide training for staff and
students to expand their skill sets and position themselves to confidently
perform the informatics elements of their research projects in an efficient and
reproducible way. The programme and workshops are under constant evolution, and
we are grateful for your feedback which is a core component of this process.

We will start by introducing the workshop leaders and helpers. We are all here
because we are passionate about sharing our knowledge and supporting the
development of our colleagues.


## Housekeeping

The workshop in organised into episodes of content, which can be seen in the
[workshop schedule]({{ site.url }}/schedule.html). Our aim is to have an official break
every 60-90 minutes, but there will also be periods in-between demonstrations
where you are free to take additional comfort breaks if required.

This workshop will be delivered by using a variety of methods: live coding,
slides, exercises, audience interaction, etc. We will have a collaborative
document where we can post resources and answer questions.
You are welcome to introduce yourselves at the top of that document.

Our aim is to be responsive to the needs of the group, both in person and
virtually. Therefore, think of the schedule as a guide rather than a strict
timetable. We welcome questions and queries as we go along: there are helpers
in the room so raise your hand if you need assistance. There is also a dedicated
helper for the virtual participants so please raise your virtual hand to
attract their attention. In order to try to provide equality for virtual and in
person participants we request that the Teams/Zoom chat is used minimally and
all questions/comments etc. are posted in our collaborative notes document.
This will be saved and distributed at the end of the workshop.  

Please conduct yourselves in line with the
[code of conduct]({{ site.url }}/code.html) â€”
essentially, be respectful and aware that we all have different backgrounds,
experiences and viewpoints.
