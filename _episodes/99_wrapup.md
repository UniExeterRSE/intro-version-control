OFFICIAL DUTIES, THE FOLLOWING IS MORE APPROPRIATE:

This workshop, and the others in the series, were put together by the Research
Software Engineering Group and its delivery is supported by a team of
volunteers. This is as part of an ongoing initiative to provide training for
staff and students to expand their skill sets and position themselves to
confidently perform the informatics elements of their research projects in an
efficient and reproducible way.
