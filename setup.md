This workshop is under development. More detailed installation instructions
will be added closer to the time of the workshops.

The following software should be installed on participants' machines before
the start of the course:
* Git (download from <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>
  and consult
  <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git</a>
  for more detailed guidance on installation).
* A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
  <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">Visual Studio Code</a>
  is recommended as it has nice integration with Git and is free, but people
  should use whatever they're comfortable with when working on source code.

Participants should have a GitHub account set up before the start of the
second session (go to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">https://github.com/</a>).
