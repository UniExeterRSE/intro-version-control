## Overview

Version control systems are an incredibly valuable tool for organising software
development. They are essential for producing reproducible and transparent
research software, coming into their own for facilitating collaborative work.
This course will give a thorough introduction to Git, one of the most widely
used version control systems in academia and industry. It will also give an
introduction to internet platforms such as GitHub and GitLab, which are built on
top of Git and designed to facilitate collaboration between software developers.
A key component of the course will be hands-on practice using Git and GitHub,
working through theoretical concepts that will be explained with the aid of live
demonstrations. This will culminate in a workshop session where participants
will work in groups on a small project designed to consolidate their
understanding. By the end of the course, it is intended participants will be
comfortable using Git and GitHub for their day-to-day work.


## Course objectives

On completion of this series of workshops, participants will be able to:

- Use Git to manage their software development.
- Explain what repositories, commits, branches and merges are in Git.
- Apply standard Git commands as part of their development workflow: cloning,
  pulling from and pushing to repositories; adding and committing file changes;
  creating and working with branches; merging branches and resolving
  merge conflicts. 
- Give examples of what should and should not be included in Git repositories.
- Describe how Git and platforms like GitHub and GitLab relate to each other and
  their differences.
- Use pull requests and issues to collaborate effectively with others on GitHub.
- Have the confidence to learn more advanced applications of Git and GitHub as
  required for their work.


## Pre-requisite knowledge

- A willingness to work with Git and GitHub in a hands-on way throughout the
  sessions.

- Basic familiarity of working at the command line (e.g. Bash, Command Prompt,
  Apple Terminal) is helpful but not essential. A good introduction to this for
  Unix-like systems (Linux, MacOS) can be found at the sister course
  <a href="https://uniexeterrse.github.io/intro-unix-shell/" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">Introduction to Unix Shell</a>.

- Version control systems are primarily used for source code  development, so
  experience writing some code (e.g. R, Python, LaTeX, bash scripts, C,...) is
  helpful though not essential.


## Workshop format

This is a hybrid workshop that runs over 3 sessions. The
[schedule can be found here](./schedule.html).


## Upcoming course dates

The sessions will be delivered in the Spring term in 2023. The specific dates
are being finalised.
