## Overview

Version control systems are an incredibly valuable tool for organising software
development. They are essential for producing reproducible and transparent
research software, coming into their own for facilitating collaborative work.
This course will give an introduction to Git, one of the most widely used
version control systems in academia and industry. It will also give an
introduction to internet platforms such as GitHub and GitLab, which are built on
top of Git and designed to facilitate collaboration between software developers
and the sharing of code. A key component of the course will be hands-on practice
using Git and GitHub, working through theoretical concepts that will be explained
with the aid of live demonstrations. By the end of the course, it is intended
participants will be comfortable using the basic features of Git and GitHub to
keep a record of their day-to-day code development and share their work with others.


## Course objectives

On completion of this series of workshops, participants will be able to:

- Use Git to manage their software development.
- Explain what repositories and commits are in Git.
- Apply standard Git commands as part of their development workflow: cloning,
  pulling from and pushing to repositories; adding and committing file changes.
- Give examples of what should and should not be included in Git repositories.
- Describe how Git and platforms like GitHub and GitLab relate to each other and
  their differences.
- Understand how to share their work with others and/or make it publicly available
  through GitHub.
- Have the confidence to learn more advanced features of Git and GitHub as required
  for their work, such as working with branches and pull requests.


## Pre-requisite knowledge

- A willingness to work with Git and GitHub in a hands-on way throughout the
  sessions.

- Basic familiarity of working at a Unix command line (e.g. Apple Terminal, a terminal running Bash)
  is helpful but not essential. We have included a cheat sheet
  on basic commands that will be useful for this course on the
  [resources page]({{ site.url }}/resources.html).
  A good introduction to this topic more generally can be found at the sister course
  <a href="https://uniexeterrse.github.io/intro-unix-shell/" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">Introduction to Unix Shell</a>.

- Version control systems are primarily used for source code  development, so
  experience writing some code (e.g. R, Python, LaTeX, bash scripts, C,...) is
  helpful though not essential.
